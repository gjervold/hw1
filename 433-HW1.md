## Question 1

``` r
bridges <- read_csv("bridges.txt")
```

    ## 
    ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   STATE_CODE_001 = col_character(),
    ##   STRUCTURE_NUMBER_008 = col_character(),
    ##   ROUTE_NUMBER_005D = col_character(),

    ##   # ... with 50 more columns

``` r
length(bridges)
```

    ## [1] 134

I keep coming up with parsing failures no matter what I try. I’ve tried
searching online for help but nothing I find has worked.

## Question 2

``` r
code <- read_html("https://guide.wisc.edu/faculty/") #reads html code of faculty webpage

faculty <- code %>%
  rvest::html_nodes("body") %>% 
  xml2::xml_find_all("//li//p") %>%
  rvest::html_text()
# the data is now split into each faculty member's info
faculty[1:10]
```

    ##  [1] "AARLI,LISALecturerCounseling PsychologyEDM 2000 Univ of Wisconsin-Madison"            
    ##  [2] "ABBOTT,DANIEL EAssoc Professor (CHS)SurgeryMD 2016 University of Washington"

I was able to get the faculty info into a vector (I believe) where each
entry is a faculty member’s name, position, department, and degree
combined. I am not sure how to proceed. I know that I need to separate
the information for each faculty member into four distinct entries, then
convert all the info into a table with 3988 rows and 4 columns. I am not
sure how to do this in R.
